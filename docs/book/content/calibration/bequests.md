# Bequest Process Calibration

[TODO: This chapter needs to be finished.]

This chapter describes how we calibrate the distribution of total bequests $BQ_t$ to each living household of age $s$ and lifetime income group $j$. The matrix that governs this distribution $\zeta_{j,s}$ is seen in the household budget constraint {ref}`EqHHBC`.

A large number of papers study the effects of different bequest motives and specifications on the distribution of wealth, though there is no consensus regarding the true bequest transmission process.  See {cite}`DeNardiYang:2014`, {cite}`DeNardi:2004`, {cite}`Nishiyama:2002`, {cite}`Laitner:2001`, {cite}`GokhaleEtAl:2000`, {cite}`GaleScholz:1994`, {cite}`Hurd:1989`, {cite}`VentiWise:1988`, {cite}`KotlikoffSummers:1981`, and {cite}`Wolff:2015`.
