## [0.1.6] - 2024-05-08 10:30:00

### Added

- PR [#99](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/99), updating the continuous integration tests
- PR [#101](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/101), which sets plotting to "off" by default for the  `Calibrate` class
- PR [#102](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/102), PR [#103](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/103), PR [#104](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/104), which change dask client parameters for better memory performance
- PR [#106](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/106), which allows for alternative policy baselines and updates calls to the `ogcore.txfunc` module.
- Updated `build_and_test.yml` to run on Python 3.10 and 3.11 (dropped Python 3.9)


## [0.1.5] - 2024-04-12 10:00:00

### Added

- Adds a list of file change event triggers to `build_and_test.yml` so that those tests only run when one of those files is changed.
- Updates the codecov GH Action to version 4 and adds a secret token.
- Adds a list of file change event triggers to `deploy_docs.yml` and `docs_check.yml`, and limits `docs_check.yml` to only run on pull requests.
- Fixes a small typo in `tax_functions.md` in order to test if the event triggers worked properly (yes, they worked)
- Updated some dependencies in `environment.yml`.
- Updated three data files in the `/tests/test_io_data/` file that used output from the taxcalc package. This package was recently updated. I also changed the `test_get_data()` test in the `test_get_micro_data.py` file because the new taxcalc data included four years instead of two years. In order to conserve repo memory footprint, we deleted the last two years of the output.

## Previous versions

### Summary

- Version [0.7.0] on August 30, 2021 was the first time that the OG-USA repository was detached from all of the core model logic, which was named OG-Core. Before this version, OG-USA was part of what is now the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository. In the next version of OG-USA, we adjusted the version numbering to begin with 0.1.0. This initial version of 0.7.0, was sequential from what OG-USA used to be when the OG-Core project was called OG-USA.
- Any earlier versions of OG-USA can be found in the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository [release history](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases) from [v.0.6.4](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases/tag/v0.6.4) (Jul. 20, 2021) or earlier.
