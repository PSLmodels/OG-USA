  abstract={This article proposes a method for integrating individual effective tax rates and marginal tax rates computed from a microsimulation (partial equilibrium) model of tax policy with a dynamic general equilibrium model of tax policy that can provide macroeconomic analysis or dynamic scores of tax reforms. Our approach captures the rich heterogeneity, realistic demographics, and tax-code detail of the microsimulation model and allows this detail to inform a general equilibrium model with a relatively high degree of heterogeneity. In addition, we propose a functional form in which tax rates depend jointly on the levels of both capital income and labor income.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been considerable dis- cussion of a significant increase in the top marginal income tax rate. A salient top marginal tax rate is 70%. This note simulates the effects of a 70% top rate on different groups of filers and shows the im- pacts on revenue and macroeconomic aggregates. We find that an increase in the top marginal tax rate to 70% raises between $5 billion and $250 billion per year over the first 10 years, depending on the size of the top bracket to which this rate is applied. However, our macroeconomic simulations show that a 70% top rate lowers GDP by between 1.7% and 0.1% in the near term, although there may be posi- tive effects on GDP in the longer term.},

I show a simulation of the macroeconomic effects as well as distributional analysis resulting from the GAIN Act. I also sim- ulate the effects of a revenue neutral GAIN Act in which an increase in the marginal income tax rates in the top two personal income brackets exactly off- sets the reduction in total federal tax revenue from the EITC expansion. In the case of the GAIN Act alone, the economy experiences short-run gains, but the increased government debt quickly crowds out in- vestment and causes the economy to start shrinking significantly. In the revenue neutral case, the cost is primarily in terms of large labor supply frictions and a reallocation of the household labor-leisure and consumption-savings decisions.},

We simulate this reform under the assumptions of a closed economy and small open economy. In both cases, the TCJA reform causes significant growth in GDP and employment between 1% and 2% per year in the first 8 years. However, the increasing debt-to-GDP ratio quickly crowds out investment and causes a drag on the economy. Wage growth can range from nearly nonexistent to a mod- est 0.6%, depending critically on the assumption of how much capital will flow into the country.},

I simulate this rate cut under the assump- tions of a closed economy and small open economy, respectively. In both cases, the corporate rate cut causes government revenues to decrease and the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase. In the small open economy scenario, GDP and wages increase by around 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively. However, in the closed economy setting in which the increased debt service must be satisfied by domestic savings (crowding out), the GDP and wage gains are much smaller and short lived.},

We compare the effects of an anticipated one-third reduction in OASI benefits beginning in 2031 on an economy that maintains currently scheduled benefits. We find many of the models generate qualitatively similar results concerning budgetary and macroeconomic aggregates; however, the magnitude of the effects varies owing to the models’ structure and calibration strategies. }
