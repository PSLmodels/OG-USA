# OG-USA-Calibration

`OG-USA-Calibration` is a package that provides code and data to calibrate an overlapping-generations (OG) model, `OG-MOD`, to the economy of the United States (USA). Together, `OG-MOD` + `OG-USA-Calibration` make the `OG-USA` model that allows for dynamic general equilibrium analysis of federal fiscal policy in the United States. The model output focuses changes in macroeconomic aggregates (GDP, investment, consumption), wages, interest rates, and the stream of tax revenues over time. This documentation of the `OG-USA-Calibration` package contains the following major sections, which are regularly updated.
